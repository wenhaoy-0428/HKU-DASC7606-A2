When water levels rise too high, animal species disperse across a broader area, causing a decrease in body condition due to an inability to locate sufficient food sources. When water levels fall, the animal species gather in smaller areas, allowing alligators to hunt more effectively. This scenario is an example of how the survival of alligators is dependent upon the restriction of which factor?", "candidate_answers": "(A) decomposition rate (B) prey habitat area (C) producer output (D) water turnover", "answer": "decomposition rate", "label": "A", "answerKey": "B"}
