The OMZ is dark and cold, with oxygen concentrations less than 10% of concentrations in surface water. Oxygen concentrations are so low because of bacterial activity that breaks down organic material falling from surface waters. Given the conditions in the OMZ, which of these dissolved gases would you expect to find in large concentrations in this zone?", "candidate_answers": "(A) argon (B) nitrogen (C) carbon dioxide (D) carbon monoxide", "answer": "argon", "label": "A", "answerKey": "C"}
