{"id": "MCAS_2006_9_40", "log_likelihood": NaN, "question": "The instructions below outline the procedure for a demonstration. Materials: four 100 g metal blocks, each of a different metal four polystyrene foam cups, each containing 150 g of 10\u00b0C water Procedure: 1. Place the four cups of water next to each other on the lab bench. 2. Heat each block to a temperature of 60\u00b0C. 3. Place each heated block in a separate cup of 10\u00b0C water. 4. Measure the temperature change in each cup of water after 100 s. At the end of the demonstration, which block raised the temperature of the 10\u00b0C water the greatest amount?", "candidate_answers": "(A) the block with the greatest density (B) the block with the lowest surface area (C) the block with the greatest specific heat (D) the block with the lowest thermal conductivity", "answer": "the block with the lowest thermal conductivity", "label": "D", "answerKey": "C"}
