The change does not cause the goat any pain, but some people think that it is not right to add genes from the genome of one animal to another. Which word best describes this concern?", "candidate_answers": "(A) economic (B) biological (C) ethical (D) practical", "answer": "biological", "label": "B", "answerKey": "C"}
